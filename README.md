# Advanced Tweakables Button

Advanced Tweakables Button is a mod for Kerbal Space Program that puts an application launcher button in the editor and flight scenes that allows you to toggle the visibility of advanced tweakables without entering the settings menu.  The tweakable menus will update immediately allowing you to access advanced options or declutter them at a moments notice.
